# **Pawsome Strolls**

The Pawsome Scrolls site is designed as a responsive website allowing users to access it on various devices ranging from a mobile phone to a desktop screen. 

 The site is aimed to target people who own dogs and are looking to hire someone to care for their pet and take them out for exercise. The various sections on the page allow the potential customer to find out about the services offered and formats in which to contact the service provider.
